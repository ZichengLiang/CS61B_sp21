### Project2: Gitlet

----
 #### Main Functionality

- Saving the contents of entire directories of files: 
  - In Gitlet, this is called committing, and the saved contents themselves are called **commits**.

- Restoring a version of one or more files or entire commits: 
  - In Gitlet, this is called **checking out** those files or that commit.

- Viewing the state of your backups: 
  - In Gitlet, you view this history in something called the **log**.
  - In Gitlet, the current state in your repository can be printed as **status**

- Maintaining related sequences of commits, called **branches**.

- **Merging** changes made in one branch into another.
